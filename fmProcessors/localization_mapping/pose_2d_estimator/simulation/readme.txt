==== QUICK START ====

The simulation directory contains files that allow testing the pose_2d_estimator
in a simulated environment without ROS. 

Edit the file generate_sim_bag.launch to load the rosbag you want to work with.
Then run:

	roslaunch gen_sim_bag_armadillo_iv.launch

to once make sure that all sensor data are available for the simulation. You will
have to quit manually when the rosbag doesn't publish more messages. Then run:

	export_odom_imu_gps_to_file.py

once to export rosbag data to a suitable comma delimited format. Now you may run 

	run_simulation.sh

to perform the actual simulation.
